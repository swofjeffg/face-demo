# Face demo
Quick little demo thrown together (excuse the quality)

## How to use?
### Python dependencies
cv2:
```
pip install opencv-python
```
### Use of python script
The python script is used to pinpoint coordinates for the javascript script to use. This is used to determine whether or not each facial feature is in the correct spot for the face to be considered "constructed".
